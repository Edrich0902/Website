This project was part of a large group project where we had to develop an android application and website for a client. The project specified that we develop software for a real
client, but the client cannot be given the software. The client only gave his/her inputs to the project.

As this was a group project not all of the code in this project is mine. I worked mostly on the CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

The goal of this website is to allow the client or user to keep track of, and manage their clients and jobs.
